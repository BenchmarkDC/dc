"Primary Key","A unique identifier based off the DC Real Property ID or the Portfolio Manager ID",
"DC Real Property ID","The Square-Suffix-Lot, Parcel, or Complex (Square-Suffix-Regime) number assigned by the DC Office of Tax and Revenue that uniquely identifies the property. The first four digits are the “square,” or the tax block. Leading zeros are added if needed. Some IDs have a “suffix,” which is N, S, E, or W for North, South, East, and West. Most IDs have no suffix. In non-condominiums, the second four digits are the tax lot. Condominiums have a Complex number, which consists of a square and suffix, and then a four-digit “regime” code that is assigned to a condominium association upon incorporation. Certain old, large lots have a “parcel number” instead, which is represented by PAR followed by an 8-digit number. In the disclosure, a “*” after the number indicates a reported ID that DOEE has not matched to a covered tax lot. Any spaces and dashes have no meaning."," "

"Reported Building Gross Floor Area","The Gross Floor Area as reported by owner, in square feet. The Gross Floor Area is the total size, as measured between the principal exterior surfaces of the enclosing fixed walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) such as: occupied tenant areas, common areas, meeting areas, break rooms, restrooms, elevator shafts, mechanical equipment areas, and storage rooms.  It does not include the floor area of secondary spaces such as parking lots.","https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/glossary#GrossFloorArea "
"ENERGY STAR Score","The 1-100 score calculated by ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® that measures how well the property is performing relative to similar properties, when normalized for climate and operational characteristics. The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that at a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR Certification.","https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/how-1-100"
"Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)","The Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI), as calculated by Portfolio Manager, at the property site. This equals the amount of energy consumed at the site in thousand British thermal units (kBtus) per gross square foot (kBtu/ft2) of the property. Site EUI values are the result of self-reported entries.","https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/what-energy"
"Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)","Weather normalized Site Energy Use Intensity is the Site EUI in kBtu/ft2 of the property, normalized for weather. Weather normalization facilitates the comparison between different parts of the country and corrects for year-to-year differences in weather. Weather normalized energy is the energy your building would have used under 30-year average conditions (also referred to as climate normals). The weather in a given year may be much hotter or colder than the normal climate; weather normalized energy accounts for this difference. Note that the adjustment is for weather only, but not climate. That is, the metric evaluates your building over time, but does not account for differences between your building and other locations that have different average (normal) climates. Weather Normalized Source EUI values are the result of self-reported entries. ","https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/portfolio-manager-technical-reference-climate-and-weather"
"Source EUI (kBtu/ft²)","Source Energy Use divided by property square footage, normalized for weather. Weather-normalization is based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather data for the zip code. Source Energy Use is the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the property. In addition to what the property consumes on-site, source energy includes losses that take place during generation, transmission, and distribution of the energy, thereby enabling a complete assessment of energy consumption resulting from building operations. For this reason, Source EUI is the best way to quantify the energy performance of commercial buildings.

"Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)","Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions are the carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property. GHG emissions are expressed in Metric Tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), a universal unit of measure that combines the quantity and global warming potential of each greenhouse gas. Total Emissions is the sum of Direct Emissions (emissions associated with onsite fuel combustion) and Indirect Emissions (emissions associated with purchases of electricity, district steam, district hot water, or district chilled water. These emissions occur at the utility plant, but they are a result of the property’s energy consumption and therefore contribute to the overall GHG footprint).
